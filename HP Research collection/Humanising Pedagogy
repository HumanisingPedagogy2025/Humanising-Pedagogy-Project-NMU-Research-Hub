Nelson Mandela University has adopted a Humanising Pedagogy (HP) as the philosophical underpinning for curriculum transformation.

This is largely based on the liberatory education philosophy and work of Paulo Freire. What it means to be human, honouring and respecting everyoneâ€™s humanity and unique background, developing consciousness and agency in relation to issues of social justice/injustice, and teaching to enable development of people's (inclusive of students and staff) full human potential, are placed at the centre of the pedagogical encounter.
