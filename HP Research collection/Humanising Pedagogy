elson Mandela University's teaching philosophy is recognised as a leader in the field of "humanising pedagogy", which is largely based on the philosophy and work of Paulo Freire. It is about dislodging outdated theories and narrow-minded preconceptions of teaching, learning and human engagement in order to stimulate an enquiring approach to education.

At our university we have embraced the philosophy and praxis of a humanising pedagogy, as we believe it addresses, underpins and advances the purpose and manner in which we cultivate our humanness, the ways in which we are best able to learn. and critical ways in which we seek to put our learning to use.

As a university with a distinctive. forward-looking culture of enquiry and engagement, we are actively trying to identify, experiment with and practice what a humanising pedagogy is â€” what is looks and feels like, and how it can be implemented in our daily pedagogical encounters.

Humanising pedagogies is one of the institutional research themes of Nelson Mandela University, with many staff and students currently researching within this area. The Learning and Teaching portfolio has established the Humanising Pedagogy Praxis and Research Niche (HPPRN) as a special project and hub to coordinate, facilitate and develop the scholarly work around the humanising pedagogy. University staff and students can access various readings, media and resources relating to human pedagogy on the HP Portal.
