Welcome to the Humanising Pedagogy Research Hub, a collaborative repository supporting research and knowledge sharing on humanising pedagogy approaches in education. This project is led by researchers at Nelson Mandela University aiming to foster inclusive, student-centered learning environments through critical pedagogy, transformative practices, and culturally responsive teaching.
